# SQL Assignment Week 2: Bill Management System (Introduction to SQL)

## Learning Objectives
- Practice basic SQL syntax and retrieval operations.
- Retrieve and filter data from a database using SQL.
- Understand how to apply conditions, sorting, and aggregations.

## What You'll Need
- A computer with internet access.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
- MySQL Workbench or another SQL database environment.

## Scenario
You are tasked with retrieving and managing data from a Bill Management System's database. The system tracks customer bills, including their status, due dates, and amounts. This assignment will help you practice SQL queries related to data retrieval and filtering operations.

## Submission Instructions
1. Clone the project to your local computer.
2. Create a file named `answers.sql` in your project folder.
3. Run each query on MySQL Workbench and, once successful, copy and paste the query into `answers.sql` in VS Code.
4. Use comments to document your queries. For example:
   ```sql
   -- Question 1.1
   SELECT * FROM orders;
Push the code to GitHub when finished.
